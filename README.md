# Engineer Work Sample

Work sample to be completed to apply for the engineer position at Crowdcast.

## Todo: Almost everything, most importantly decide on an actual challenge.

## Context

At Crowdcast, we use a variety of technologies to serve realtime data to our users. Our core interactions happen with Firebase, but we also interact heavily with our own RESTful APIs.

The app in this repository is an Angular app served from a Node server.

To test your abilities, we've created a **very** incomplete app which has the responsibility of exposing a UI to our users for browsing a list of blogger's profiles.

We use appropriately-sized services to expose our data to our various apps. To simulate this condition, we created a small service (hosted at:https://crowdcast-ws.herokuapp.com/) which provides basic user profiles. All of this is fake and modeled to work with this app. All users are randomly generated, therefore please do not get offended by any weird data you may encounter.

## Setup

#### Required software & frameworks

- Node 4.x
- Angular 1.5.3

#### Starting up

The server listens to localhost:3101

```
npm start
```

#### Accessing stuff

todo: info on routes


## What's expected of you

As a general rule, you should **(TODO)**. This **could** mean reorganizing things and **probably** means adding routes, controllers, models, and specs as you feel is necessary.

Use the tools and libraries you enjoy using.

#### Aesthetics

Your presentation should be something you're proud of. The user-experience and aesthetic aspects should be well considered.

We have no expectations toward how something should look, but we do expect it to look good and feel natural.

#### Test: Specs need to pass

todo: should we write tests?


#### Feature: Display list of users (?)
